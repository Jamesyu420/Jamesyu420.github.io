I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Hansheng Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/hansheng). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from School of Statistics, East China Normal University. My research interests lie in **Image Data Analysis** and **Spatial Statistics**. I am particularly interested in the applications of statistics in **Computational Pathology** and **Computational Imaging**.
