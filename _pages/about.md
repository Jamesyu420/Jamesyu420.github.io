I am currently a third-year PhD candidate in Economics (Statistics) at [Guanghua School of Management](https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn), Peking University, advised by [Prof. Hansheng Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/hansheng). 
I am also a visiting postgraduate student at [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Can Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/eeyangc/home). 
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from School of Statistics, East China Normal University. My research interests lie in **Multiple Instance Learning** and **Spatial Statistics**. I am particularly interested in the applications of statistics in **Computational Pathology** and **Spatial Transcriptomics**.
